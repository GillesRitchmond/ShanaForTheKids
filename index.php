                                currently resides in West Orange New Jersey, currently working towards her bachelor’s degree in psychology
                                at Montclair State University. She immigrated to the United States at a young age, where she thrived scholastically
                                but never lost sight of her how blessed and how many people like her are not afforded the same opportunism she is.

                                Haiti is one of, if not the poorest and most desperate nation in the world, with two thirds of the nation’s populace
                                living off just 2 dollars (USD) and 25 percent of the people living in extreme poverty basic survival is almost at premium in Haiti.
                                While visiting her native land, Shanaelle experienced first hand the tremendous poverty and despair that has consumed the nation.
                                Most notably the children were the most affected. Nearly 100,000 children of Haiti under the age of 5 suffer from acute malnutrition.
                                This coupled with over 30 % of population that is considered by the United Nations as “Food Insecure”. The poverty problem is only
                                magnified by the stark lack of education currently available. Haiti’s 60.5 percent literacy rate is among the lowest in the world,
                                incompared to the 92 percent literacy rate enjoyed by other Caribbean and Latin American nations this is an embarrassment to the
                                hemisphere.

                                During her “vacation” Shanaelle felt a pull to “Do-something” for her children of Haiti. Coincidently she met Fransnel Dorsainvil
                                who was a member of the organization PAC-Haiti. Shanaelle became an Ambassador for the organization and began to participate in
                                several events and activities sponsored by PAC-Haiti. This included fundraising, outreach, distribution of food, medicine,
                                and school supplies to the most at-risk members of the community. The education Shanaelle received working with the PAC-Haiti
                                has prepared her to begin sowing the seeds for her own organization that will more directly display her vision of how an organization
                                could be most effective in curtailing some of the hardships impoverished children face.

                        In July 2017, We visited a community called Despuzeau where a feeding program was available for the most vulnerable children. I was honored to serve 
                        the children, share with them and spend some quality time with them.
                        We serve  50-100 kids.

                        In August 2018, We went to the same community. where we had a Psyco-educative day for the kids. We spent the day with them, we eat, drink, play with them, 
                        and we also had some People who did some sessions for them. For example, we had a group of Nurse, who had a presentation about Adolescent Sexual Behavior for 
                        the teens, we had a dentist who had a presentation about hygiene, A teacher who had a presentation about Importance of education, and a Social worker/secretary 
                        who had a presentation about Self-esteem. At the end of the day, Shana who came from USA had a little surprise for the kids. The surprise was an Hygiene 
                        kit(Toothbrush,Toothpaste,Soap). We serve 150-170 kids.
